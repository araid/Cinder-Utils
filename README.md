Cinder-Utils
============

A small collection of Cinder examples and helpful classes that are not big enough to turn into a separate block, in the style of Paul Houx's great [Cinder-Samples](https://github.com/paulhoux/Cinder-Samples/).

Meant to be used with the glNext branch of Cinder and only tested in MacOS.

#####Downloading and using the samples with Cinder
* Download the Cinder Framework, ideally from Git (http://libcinder.org/docs/welcome/GitSetup.html)
* Clone this repo or download it as a zip next the Cinder folder, that ideally should be named ```cinder_glNext```;

Materials Library
=================

A small collection of shading techniques in one single app that makes it easy to compare, modify and pick the right shader for a project.

Inspired by material libraries used in 3D software like [this](http://www.reynantemartinez.com/cycles-material-studies.html).

The idea here is to have only self contained classes that perform single-pass shading calculations to light 3D geometry. No post processing or FBOs, and everything well commented so it's easy to learn.

Future additions

- [ ] Valve TF2
- [ ] Rim/halo shading
- [ ] Phong with light warping
- [ ] Cubemap
